# Contributing to Uppload

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Uppload and its packages. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Uppload Code of Conduct](https://github.com/elninotech/uppload/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [info@elnino.tech](mailto:info@elnino.tech).

## Translations

Currently, the translations are mostly machine-generated using the Google Cloud Translation API, so they're not highly accurate. Please feel free to fork this repository, edit the translation for your language, and send in a pull request. The translations are in the `/modules/i18n/` folder and use the ISO 639-1 standard for file names (for example, `en.js`).
