1. Find the DeviantArt URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "DeviantArt" button in the widget
3. Paste the DeviantArt URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from DeviantArt" buttom

## How do I find the DeviantArt URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the DeviantArt icon?

If you don't see the DeviantArt icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from DeviantArt; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the DeviantArt import feature
