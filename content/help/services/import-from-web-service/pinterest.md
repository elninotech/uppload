# Import image from Pinterest

## How do I upload an image using Pinterest?

You can import an image using its Pinterest URL and then perform manipulations (like cropping or filters). Pinterest URLs start with "pinterest.com" or "pin.it".

1. Find the Pinterest URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "Pinterest" button in the widget
3. Paste the Pinterest URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from Pinterest" buttom

## How do I find the Pinterest URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the Pinterest icon?

If you don't see the Pinterest icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from Pinterest; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the Pinterest import feature
