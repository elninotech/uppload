1. Find the Tumblr URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "Tumblr" button in the widget
3. Paste the Tumblr URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from Tumblr" buttom

## How do I find the Tumblr URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the Tumblr icon?

If you don't see the Tumblr icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from Tumblr; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the Tumblr import feature
