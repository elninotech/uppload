# Import image from Flipboard

## How do I upload an image using Flipboard?

You can import an image using its Flipboard URL and then perform manipulations (like cropping or filters). Flipboard URLs start with "flipboard.com" or "flip.it".

1. Find the Flipboard URL of your photo and copy it
2. Click on the "Flipboard" button in the widget
3. Paste the Flipboard URL in the textbox
4. Click on the "Import from Flipboard" buttom

## How do I find the Flipboard URL of an image?

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the Flipboard icon?

If you don't see the Flipboard icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from Flipboard; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the Flipboard import feature
