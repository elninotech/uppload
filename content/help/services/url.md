## How do I find the URL of an image?

### Web

On the web, open the picture you want to select and copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

## Why don't I see the URL icon?

If you don't see the URL icon, it could be because:

- Your browser does not support importing an image from URL; if this is the case, you should update your browser
- The website has not enabled the URL import feature
