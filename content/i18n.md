# Internationalization

Uppload is very easy to localize. For example, if you want to use Uppload in English, simply import `en` and specify it in the `lang` parameter of the constructor:

```ts
import { Uppload, en } from "uppload";

const profilePicture = new Uppload({
  lang: en,
});
```

If you want to overwrite some keys, you can do that too:

```ts
const lang = en;
lang.services.local.drop = "Drag and drop files here";

const profilePicture = new Uppload({ lang });
```

Similarly, you can add your own language pack:

```ts
const nl = {
  errors.response_not_ok: "Error",
  imagesPoweredBy: "Images powered by $1$"
  // ...and so on
};

const profilePicture = new Uppload({ lang: nl });
```

As you'll see in the code sample above, terms such as `$1$` (in general, `$n$` where `n` is a number) are replaced by variables in templates using the [i18n helper](https://github.com/elninotech/uppload/tree/master/src/helpers/i18n.ts).

Finally, if you're building your own language pack for Uppload, you can also contribute it to the open-source project. Simply go ahead and create a `lang.ts` file in the `./src/i18n` directory (where `lang` is the two letter ISO code for the language) using `en.ts` as the base.

## Dynamically changing language

If you want to change the language once the plugin has already initialized or opened, you can use the following:

```ts
import { Uppload, en, nl } from "uppload";

const profilePicture = new Uppload({ lang: en });

// When users click on the button, change language to dutch
const button = document.querySelector("button");
if (button)
  button.addEventListener("click", () =>
    profilePicture.updateSettings({ lang: nl })
  );
```
